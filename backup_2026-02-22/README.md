Scenario & Response Card Game

Overview
- A quick party card game where one player reads a scenario and others play their funniest response card. The group votes for the most humorous response; the winner scores a point.

Components
- Scenario deck (scenario_cards.txt)
- Response deck (response_cards.txt)
- 3–12 players (best with 4–8)
- 7 response cards dealt to each player

Setup
- Shuffle both decks separately.
- Deal 7 response cards to each player.
- Place the scenario deck face-down in the center.
- Choose a starting player to be the "Judge" for the first round.

Gameplay (one round)
1. The Judge draws and reads aloud the top scenario card.
2. Each other player chooses one response card from their hand and places it face-down in a pile.
3. The Judge shuffles the played responses (anonymous), reveals them, and selects the funniest.
4. The player who played the chosen response gets 1 point and keeps the scenario card as a score token.
5. All players draw back up to 7 response cards.
6. Pass the Judge role clockwise and repeat.

Winning
- Play until a player reaches a target score (e.g., 5 points) or after a set number of rounds. The highest score wins.

Variants
- Team Play: Players split into teams; judge is neutral; team votes after responses.
- Speed Round: Players have 5 seconds to choose a response card.
- Themed Decks: Create themed scenario/response lists (workplace, dating, sci-fi, etc.).

House Rules (optional)
- Double-judge: Two players act as judges and combine scores.
- Roast Mode: Judge awards 2 points for a response that is both funny and surprisingly clever.

Example Round
- Judge reads: "You accidentally texted your boss instead of your partner. What did you say?"
- Responses played (examples): "I love you more than spreadsheets." — chosen; that player scores 1 point.
